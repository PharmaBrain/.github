# About Us

Decision makers face a range of obstacles to bring a drug to market. Over 90% of drugs in clinical development fail and only 4% reach their two-year sales forecasts. 

Understandably, one of the key challenges is competition that has become increasingly intense and diverse. 

As a result, big pharma companies have adapted their approach and leverage competitive intelligence as a means of increasing their chances of success and accelerating time-to-market. 

However, the majority of decision makers involved in drug development lack the necessary resources, skill sets and knowledge to design an impactful competitive intelligence system.

To solve for this, **we are building PharmaBrain to democratize access to competitive insights.**

This will transform how decision makers in drug development prioritize initiatives and collaborate.
