# About Us

Pharma leaders face a range of obstacles to bring a drug to market. Over 90% of drugs in clinical development fail and only 4% reach their two-year sales forecasts. 

Understandably, one of the key challenges is competition that has become increasingly intense and diverse. 

As a result, big pharma companies have adapted their approach and leverage competitive intelligence as a means of increasing their chances of success and accelerating time-to-market. 

However, the majority of pharma companies and leaders lack the necessary resources, skill sets and knowledge to design an impactful competitive intelligence system.

To solve for this, at Atacana we are leveraging our thought leadership in pharma competitive intelligence combined with machine learning to democratize access to competitive tools and insights.

This will transform how decision makers in pharma develop strategies, prioritize initiatives, and collaborate.
